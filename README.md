Machine Learning and Bioinformatics Framework for Breast Cancer Subtype Classification and Biomarker Discovery

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project presents an integrative approach combining **bioinformatics analysis** and **machine learning models** to identify reliable biomarkers and classify molecular subtypes of **breast cancer** (BRCA) using **microarray gene expression data** from GEO datasets.
By leveraging tools such as differential expression analysis, protein-protein interaction networks, survival analysis, and supervised machine learning (Random Forest & KNN), the study uncovers 35 potential subtype-specific biomarkers and evaluates their diagnostic and prognostic significance.

ðŸ”¬ Objectives

Identify DEGs linked to breast cancer subtypes using GEO microarray data.
Construct PPI networks and identify key hub genes.
Perform subtype-specific DEG analysis to find unique molecular signatures.
Develop ML models for subtype classification and biomarker prioritization.

ðŸ§ª Datasets Used

**GSE86374** (10 normal, 50 tumor samples)
**GSE57297** (7 normal, 25 tumor samples)
